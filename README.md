## ⚙️ Common Setup & Tools

- 📦 **Base OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian-based)  
  A terminal-only operating system, ideal for low-RAM devices like the Raspberry Pi.

- 🔐 **Security**:  
  SSH with public key authentication, firewall using UFW, optional intrusion prevention with `fail2ban`.

- 📡 **Remote Access**:  
  Remote VPN access via WireGuard.

- 🔄 **Automation**:  
  Task scheduling with `cron`, background services via `systemd`, and custom shell scripts.

## 📌 Notes

- Each project has its own `README.md` with setup instructions, configurations, and tips.
- Whenever possible, I follow the **KISS** principle – *Keep It Simple, Stupid*.
- This list is growing over time and ordered chronologically by creation date.
- Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements.
